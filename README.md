# Food Freshness & Quality Classifier

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to classify food images into
Fresh, Okay, or Spoiled categories.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Transfer Learning (CNN)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## Status
🚧 In progress
# food-freshness-classifier
AI-based food freshness and quality classification using deep learning
## Dataset
Fruits Fresh and Rotten dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing images of fresh and spoiled fruits across multiple categories.

## Methodology
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Transfer learning using MobileNetV2
- Multi-class classification (6 classes)
- Model fine-tuning for performance improvement

## Results
The final model achieved approximately 90–95% validation accuracy.

## Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using accuracy plots, loss curves, and confusion matrix analysis.

## Sample Visualizations
